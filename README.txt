1. in project root directory       : npm install -> node index.js (start server)
2. in client directory (cd client) : npm install -> npm start 	  (start client app)
3. in admin directory (cd admin)   : npm install -> npm start     (start admin app)

*Note: client and admin CAN'T run simultaneously. So we have to shut one down and start the other.
